Components used were the accordion and the modal feature connecting to a form for "visitors" to fill out information for subscription to a newsletter about my page and more information about the website.

A few pieces that were difficult was still understanding the column and number situation and knowing how to determine the amount of column space needed. Therefore, I didn't step too far out of the comfort zone, but realizing the elements of Bootstrap and its capabilities of being able to design a website with that amount of flow seems challenging yet the idea of it is more appealing than the standard css stylesheet and earlier HTM we learned.
